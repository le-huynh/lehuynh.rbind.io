# Hello! Xin Chào!

I'm a young researcher who's all about microbiology, biostatistics, and R programming. 
I use R to delve into data, create cool visuals, and automate processes. 
But what excites me the most is open science and crafting nifty digital tools for research.  

My journey into this exciting realm began in 2016, and I've been busy ever since. 
I'm passionate about data science, especially when it involves understanding health risks related to water. 
It's amazing how data can contribute to the protection and improvement of public health, 
making it a central focus of my academic and professional adventure.  

This blog is a collection of random thoughts, tips, and technical stuff on my coding journey. 
Most of the posts are personal notes to my future self, who I'm sure has forgotten many things.  

Hey, future me – read this blog before setting your computer on fire!
