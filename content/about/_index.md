# Hello! Xin Chào!

→ [Curriculum Vitae](https://lehuynh.rbind.io/cv/cv_pagedown.pdf)  

I'm a young researcher with substantial experience in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. 
I use R to delve into data, create cool visuals, and automate processes. 
But what excites me the most is open science and crafting nifty digital tools for research.  

My journey into this exciting realm began in 2016, and I've been busy ever since. 
I'm particularly passionate about data science, especially when it involves understanding environmental issues and enhancing public health. 
My works have encompassed various [projects](https://lehuynh.rbind.io/project/) spanning environmental science, health science, and biology. 
It's amazing how data can contribute to the protection and improvement of human well-being, making it a central focus of my academic and professional adventure.  

This [blog](https://lehuynh.rbind.io/post/) is a collection of random thoughts, tips, and technical stuff on my coding journey. 
Most of the posts are personal notes to my future self, who I'm sure has forgotten many things.  

Hey, future me – read this blog before setting your computer on fire!
