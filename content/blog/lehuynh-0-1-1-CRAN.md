I am thrilled to announce that my personal R package, <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a>, is now officially available on CRAN!  

<a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> is a collection of miscellaneous R functions and templates that I've found particularly useful over time. 
It includes:

- Functions for graphics, data importation, data transformation, and general utilities.
- Templates for exploratory analysis, Bayesian modeling, and crafting scientific manuscripts.

#### A Learning Journey
Publishing <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> on CRAN has been an incredibly educational experience. 
Throughout the process, I learned a lot about package development, from structuring the package correctly to ensuring compliance with CRAN's submission guidelines.  

Big thanks to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_team.htm" target="_blank">CRAN team</a> for their invaluable feedback. 
Their suggestions were instrumental in refining and improving my package. 
After incorporating their feedback, <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> has become much better and more robust.  

I also want to acknowledge the numerous references and resources that guided me through the preparation and submission process. 
These resources saved me a significant amount of time and effort. 
If you're considering submitting your own package to CRAN, I highly recommend leveraging the wealth of knowledge available in the R community.

#### More Than Just a Collection of Code
For me, <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> is more than just a collection of useful code and templates. 
It's a personal project that has allowed me to experiment and learn new things. 
Whether it's writing templates or understanding the intricacies of publishing on platforms like CRAN and Zenodo, <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> has been my playground for exploration and growth.  

I hope you find <a href="https://le-huynh.github.io/lehuynh/" target="_blank">`lehuynh`</a> as useful as I have. 
You can install the package directly from CRAN using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("lehuynh")
```

<br/>

To get the latest in-development features, install the development version from GitHub:

```
if(!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
 install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("le-huynh/lehuynh")
```

Additionally, this package is accessible for download via Zenodo with the DOI <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11522849" target="_blank">10.5281/zenodo.11522849</a>.
