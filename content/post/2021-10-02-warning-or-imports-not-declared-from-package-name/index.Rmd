#### Question
I am creating a new function in my Rpackage. 
After running `devtools::check()`, I get this WARNING:  

```yaml
checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING
'::' or ':::' imports not declared from:
  ‘dplyr’ 
```

I would like to correct it.  

#### Answer
Add `dplyr` to `Imports` in the `DESCRIPTION` file.  

```{r , highlight=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
#> Adding dplyr to Imports
#> Refer to functions with dplyr::fun()
```
