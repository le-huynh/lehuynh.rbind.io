#### Tips
1. Go to the GitHub repo you would like to download the folder.

```
# For example
https://github.com/le-huynh/writing_journal_article_in_rmarkdown
```

<br>

2. Replace `.com` with `.dev` in the URL to access the repository using [github.dev](https://github.com/github/dev) web-based editor.

```
# For example
https://github.dev/le-huynh/writing_journal_article_in_rmarkdown
```

<br>

3. Within the `EXPLORER` panel (located on the left-hand side or accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>), right-click on the specific file or folder you need and choose the option `Download...`.

4. When prompted with the `Select Folder` dialog box, pick the directory on your computer where you'd like the chosen file or folder to be saved.
