*A collaboration with Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Denmark*

- Topics: Bioinformatics, Proteomics data analysis, health science, mass spectrometry
- Contributions: Data analysis, data visualization, code management
- Tools: R, RMarkdown, Git, GNU Make


This collaborative project aims to identify a broad spectrum of druggable key signaling pathways in various AML mouse models and subsequently in AML patient samples. 
The outcomes have the potential to pave the way for personalized AML treatments by targeting specific signaling pathways, thereby revolutionizing clinical interventions for this challenging disease.
