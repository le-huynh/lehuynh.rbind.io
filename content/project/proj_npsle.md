This collaborative project aims to identify a potential spectrum of biomarkers for predicting NPSLE, offering crucial clinical insights before the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
Using a novel Bayesian model, the project determined the cutoff concentration of anti-suprabasin antibodies and associated predictive values (PPV, NPV). 
The findings from this project could assist in clinical trials, aid in making decisions about patient care, guide treatment choices, and enable cost-effective interventions.
