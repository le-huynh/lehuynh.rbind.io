#### I take responsibility for my own words and all the content created by myself.

I am committed to the “Civility Enforced” standard: I will not post unacceptable content.

I define unacceptable content as anything included or linked to that:  

<ul>
<li>is being used to abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others</li>
<li>is libelous, knowingly false, ad-hominem, or misrepresents another person</li>
<li>infringes upon a copyright or trademark</li>
<li>violates an obligation of confidentiality</li>
<li>violates the privacy of others</li>
</ul>

I define and determine what is “unacceptable content” on a case-by-case basis, and my definitions are not limited to this list. [I reserve the right to change these standards at any time with no notice.]

#### I won’t say anything online that I wouldn’t say in person.

This blog contains my personal thoughts and opinions. Accordingly, I have decided to share on this site only words that I would say in a personal conversation, namely always pay attention to a cultivated contact with my fellow humans.

#### I connect privately before I respond publicly.

When I encounter conflicts and misrepresentation in the blogosphere, I make every effort to talk privately and directly to the person(s) involved–or find an intermediary who can do so—before I publish any posts about the issue.

#### I take action when I believe someone is unfairly attacking another.

When someone who is publishing comments or blog postings that are offensive, I will tell them so (privately, if possible—see above) and ask them to publicly make amends.
If those published comments could be construed as a threat, and the perpetrator doesn’t withdraw them and apologize, I will cooperate with law enforcement to protect the target of the threat.

#### I ignore the trolls.

I prefer not to respond to nasty comments about my person, work or blog, as long as they don’t veer into abuse or libel. I believe that feeding the trolls only encourages them—*“Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty, but the pig likes it.”* Ignoring public attacks is often the best way to contain them.
